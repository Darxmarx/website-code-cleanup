# Horiseon Website Codebase Cleanup

## Description

Horiseon's pitched website was always functional, but it did not meet appropriate standards for general accessibility and optimization for a consumer base. Now, the website is ready for enhanced online traffic.

## Usage

At a glance, Horiseon's website appears identical to how it looked when it initially launched--and to a certain extent, that remains true. The changes made to this website were mostly back-end, resulting in a much cleaner codebase that runs the website to begin with. Perhaps the simplest change is the alteration of the website's title, seen upon checking the website's tab in a browser: formerly known as the generic "website," the title is now labeled "Horiseon Website Traffic Improvements," clearly stating the website's intentions. Upon viewing the source code, all of the HTML elements now follow a semantic structure, and the code itself is optimized, eliminating repetition and allowing the website to use up less memory. An additional accessibility change involves properly adding alt text for every single image on the page, enabling both users with screen-reading assistance and users with struggling internet to still understand all of the contents on the page. Overall, the changes implemented into the codebase help to meet accessibility standards and promote search engine optimization.
